# CSC690FinalProjectFall2020
## Milestone 1: Getting set up 
### Application proposal
My application proposal is a cataloging app for users to present their general tastes in media consumption. Similar to rateyourmusic (music), letterbox(films), backloggd(games), I want to be able to create an app where people can get to know each otherâ€™s tastes better. The app would contain a checklist for users to share, that can list the enjoyment rating of the task/media consumed, the duration, and a review of their experience. The goal I have in mind for the visual appearance is something like a business card, but for a person's tastes in media.
### Must have features
- Create an entry that features the title, rating, duration, tag, and review of the media consumed.
- Create a checklist of media to consume
- Create a list of planned to watch, currently watching, watched, and dropped media
### Nice to have feature
- Create a profile with a profile picturem, favorite media, and about yourself bio.
- Access a database to visit official media
- Search through tags
### Create some basic wire-frames for your main feature

## Milestone 2: Prototype
### Estimate how much work each feature will take to implement (in hours)
- Creating the base entry for a review - 2 hours
- Creating those entries into a list - 1 hour
- Search function - 2 hours
- User Profile containing both entries and lists - 2 hours
- Creating a shareable profile - 2 hour 
- Database accessing - 3 hours
- Time to learn and research - 5-9 hours (?)
`Total - 12 hours to 20 hours`
